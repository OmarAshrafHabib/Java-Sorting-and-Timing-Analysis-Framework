# Java Sorting and Timing Analysis Framework

This project benchmarks the performance of Selection Sort and Merge Sort in Java. It includes a `Sorter` class with both sorting algorithms and a `TimeTest` class to measure sorting durations on randomized data, enabling analysis of sorting efficiency at different scales.

## Features
- **Selection Sort** and **Merge Sort** implementations.
- **Timing Analysis**: Measures sorting time across various input sizes.
- **Data Generation**: Creates random data for consistent benchmarking.

##Project Structure
Sorter.java: Implements selectionSort and mergeSort.
TimeTest.java: Benchmarks sorting durations.
ComparableTicket.java, Util.java: Supporting classes.
